#Caveats
Please be aware that in my phone screen, I said I had never done Ruby on Rails.
Because of the learning curve, I did not get to refine and cleanup the code.

There are a couple of problems that I did not get to fix due to time:
 index/listing page - no friend count
 view page - the friend drop down works, but shows duplicate names
 
I also did not get to do any automated testing. Just ran out of time to learn and complete.

I am very sure with more learning time, I could cleanup the code and write the automated tests.

I did a lot of functional testing and documented some of it below.
